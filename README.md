# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction



# This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and more, we build predictive models that estimate the resale price of vehicles accurately.

# 

# 📌 Objective



# To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on its specifications and historical data.

# 

# 🧠 Features Used



# Car brand and model

# Year of manufacture

# Kilometer driven

# Fuel type

# Transmission type

# Number of owners

# Engine 

# Mileage 

# Location

# 

# 🛠️ Machine Learning Algorithms Used



# Linear Regression

# Decision Tree Regressor

# Random Forest Regressor

# Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

# Lasso and Ridge Regression

# 

# 📊 Workflow



# Data Collection

# Data Cleaning \& Preprocessing

# Feature Engineering

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Model Training \& Evaluation

# Model Comparison

# Final Model Selection

# Price Prediction for New Data

# 

# 📦 Libraries Used



# pandas

# numpy

# matplotlib \& seaborn

# scikit-learn

# pickle (for model saving)

# 

# 🧪 Results



# The models were evaluated using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE.

# 

# The best performing model was selected based on accuracy and generalization.🚗 Used Car Price Prediction
